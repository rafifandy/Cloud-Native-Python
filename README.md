# Cloud Native Python
This is the code repository for [Cloud Native Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cloud-native-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787129313), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that having their own infrastructure to support their expansion is not feasible. As a result, they have been resorting to the elasticity of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their highly scalable applications.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective chapter folders.
Chapters 9, 12, and 13 do not contain any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
self.addUser = function() {
    self.save();
    self.name(""); 
    self.username(""); 
    self.email("");
    self.password("");
};
```

You will need to have Python installed on your system. A text editor, preferably
Vim/Sublime/Notepad++, would be great. For one of the chapters, you may be required to
download POSTMAN, which is a powerful API testing suite available as a Chrome
extension. You can download this at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en.
Other than these, it would be great if you have an account on the following web applications:

* Jenkins
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services
* Terraform

In case you do not have an account, this book will guide you, or at least direct you with
regards to creating an account on the previously mentioned web applications.
